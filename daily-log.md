# 100 Days Of Code | Part 2 - Daily Log

## Day 1: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I spent 30 minutes (actually used a timer) going through the [LearnToCode RPG Game by FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/2022-become-a-dev-new-years-resolution-challenge/).

**Thoughts:** I used a timer because I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it as I'm not known to be a game player. To my surprise, I really enjoyed my time, I'd say it has a different vibe and I like it, looking forward to continuing from where I stopped tomorrow.

Lastly, [I had some challenges with installing the game on my Macbook Pro.](https://itch.io/profile/godswillumukoro) which led me to install it on my Lenovo Chromebook which runs Elementary OS (Linux).
